    <h1>Sushi Recipes</h1>
    <p>Today, we're making a variation on the California roll. Along with sushi rice and sheets of seaweed 
        (nori), California rolls require only a few ingredients: crab meat (or imitation), avocado, and 
        cucumber. If you like, mix the crab meat with a little mayo to create a creamy consistency.</p>

        <p>To this basic list of ingredients, we've added sliced carrots and cooked shrimp...because that's 
            how we (sushi) roll. Before we got further, a quick note on sushi rice. You can't use just any 
            rice for sushi. Sushi rice is a special preparation of rice flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and 
            salt. It's made from short-grain rice (Japonica), typically made in Japan and parts of California 
            and Italy. With homemade sushi rice, you're aiming for rice that's fluffy and a little sticky but 
            not too sticky. Give it a try -- you'll get the hang of it. See how to make sushi rice.</p>
            <h2>Here's What You'll Need:</h2>
            <p>To make sushi at home, you'll need a few essential tools for making sushi:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bamboo rolling mat (makisu)</li>
                <li>Plastic wrap</li>
                <li>Sharp knife</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Make California Roll Sushi</h2>
            <p>This is the traditional way to roll any type of rolled sushi, which is called maki sushi. 
                There are actually two options for this method: rolling with the sushi rice on top of the 
                sheet of nori, as we do here; or with the nori flipped over so the rice ends up on the outside
                 of the finished roll (uramaki sushi).</p>

                 <ol>
                    <li>Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon)</li>
                    <li> Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori </li>
                    <li> Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori</li>
                    <li> Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi</li>
                    <li>Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top</li>
                    <li> Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board</li>
                    <li> Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates</li>
                 </ol>
